## Introduction
This is the software portion of an open source espresso machine. 

The controller software currently runs on an Arduino Mega 2560. In the future there will also be software for serial communication and datalogging that will run on a personal computer. This espresso machine should provide a flexible platform for trying out new ideas. Pressure profiling, flow profiling, neural network controlled heating elements and anything else you or I can think of. If you've got another idea, please tell us. If you feel comfortable coding, fork the repo and hack away.
